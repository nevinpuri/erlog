## Erlog

A self hosted server to send and view all your application logs.

## Otel Support

Right now I think otel is too much of a pain to use in small/medium sized projects. If otel becomes easier to use, or enough people ask for otel support, then I'll consider adding support for it.

## Todo

- make docs on using erlog with specific libraries
